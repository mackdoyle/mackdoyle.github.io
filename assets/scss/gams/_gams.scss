/**
 * Gams
 * Updated: 12-27-2013
 * @author Jason Doyle
 * @version 0.1

 * Gams is a boilerplate Scss library extended from Bitters. It is meant to be dropped
 * into a new project and give you a nice starting point.
 * By design, Gams only effects standard tags. So no class definitions need to be added to use it.

 * Learn more about Bitters (bitters.bourbon.io)
 * Requires Bourbon (bourbon.io)
