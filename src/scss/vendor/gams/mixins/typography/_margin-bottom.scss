/**
 * Margin Bottom Mixin
 * Allows for quickly applying a standard bottom margin, with pixel fallback, which helps
 * establish vertical rhythm. It should be close to the content's line height.
 * Typically apply this to elements that might appear in a content block, like
 * p, ul, code, iframe, img, etc. so they all conform to the same standard.
 *
 * @param $margin - Optional. The value in decimal
 *

/* Usage
 * p {
 *   @include margin-bottom(1.5);
 * }

 * Results In...
 * p {
 *   margin-bottom: 24px;
 *   margin-bottom: 1.5;
